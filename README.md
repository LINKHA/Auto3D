Auto3D
====  
2D and 3D game engine  
Game rendering framework based on OpenGL(future plans to use vulkan and Direct3D 12)

Written in the beginning
-------
The UI and general 3D model rendering is now almost complete
The project continues to be updated with plans to refine much of the game engine

Compiling from source
-------
It is recommended to use Cmake v3.1 or above to create a solution.
Create the Build file under your project and generate it directly using CMake without any other action
(tested under the environment of Windows XP and above, and realized the compilation and generation)
